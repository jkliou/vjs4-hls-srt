2
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,740
Gentlemen, we are in danger. There is a storm coming.

3
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,660
My men are terrified. We must leave.

4
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,370
That tomb is here somewhere. I can feel it.

5
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,080
Please, Robert, it's been two months!

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,410
Archie, I'm not stopping!

7
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,620
Dad!

8
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,670
What's going on with this wind, Pop?

9
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,090
C.J, go wait in the truck.

10
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,420
I don't want to just wait in the truck.

11
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,840
I said go! Windows up!

12
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,380
Robert!

13
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,470
-Mr. Fredericks! -What?

14
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,020
Ah!

15
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,040
Help!

16
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,120
Help!

17
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,950
C.J? Are you all right?

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Yeah, I'm fine!

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,740
I'm coming down!

20
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,660
Yes!

21
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,880
I looked for the tomb of Ahkmenrah for 20 years,

22
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
and what do you do?

23
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,920
You fall right into it!

24
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Amir, start loading the trucks.

25
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,090
Mr. Fredericks...

26
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
there is no time.

27
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,180
The storm is almost upon us.

28
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,470
Then you'd better hurry.

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,270
Come on. Everybody works.

30
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,650
Hey! What's the matter with you? Huh?

31
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,860
He said, "We must leave this place immediately.

32
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,990
If anyone disturbs this tomb...

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
"the end will come."

34
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,880
"The end will come."

35
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,010
We load the trucks.

36
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,820
I can't help feeling we're making a terrible mistake!

37
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,700
We're not making a mistake, we're making history!

38
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,040
Don't worry!

39
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,410
C.J! Let's go!

40
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,010
"The end will come."

41
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,860
Welcome, everyone, to the Grand Reopening...

42
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,020
of the newly renovated Hayden Planetarium...

43
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,940
here at the Museum of Natural History.

44
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,700
New York's glitterati have all turned out...

45
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,240
for what has promised to be a memorable evening...

46
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,200
filled with the dazzling special effects...

47
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,910
and technical wizardry we've all come to admire from this museum...

48
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,790
and its renowned Night Program.

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Tonight gonna be fun-fun!

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,630
Here come Dum Dum!

51
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,040
Hey, how we doing, Sac?

52
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,800
Rexy is waxed and buffed.

53
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,880
Teddy is grooming his moustache.

54
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,220
Oh, and I reviewed fire safety procedures with the primordial men.

55
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,010
By the way, have you seen them lately?

56
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,140
The museum has added a new one.

57
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,390
What? No.

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,720
Oh, and make sure the centurions stretch, all right?

59
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,060
They really went for it in the dress rehearsal...

60
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,230
and they're just not used to those kinds of dance moves.

61
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,900
Okay, everybody. Everybody, listen up.

62
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,230
I don't want to make anybody nervous...

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,940
but the mayor and the governor are both out there.

64
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,990
And, uh, I'm not 100 percent sure,

65
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,070
but I think Regis Philbin, too.

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,820
Reeju Philbo?

67
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,320
Yeah, Reeju Philbo.

68
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,450
Okay, Rexy, do me a favor.

69
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,910
Watch the tail, okay? There's gonna be open flame.

70
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,620
Oh, Dexter...

71
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,000
how you doing, my man?

72
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,250
All limbered up?

73
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,580
Looking good. I like the tie.

74
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,290
Got kind of a Chippendales thing going on.

75
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,670
All chalked up, ready to go?

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,590
Good. Okay, everybody relax and have fun, okay?

77
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,670
Larry.

78
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,800
You better come see this.

79
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,510
Have you ever seen it like this before?

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Never.

81
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,520
This corrosion has never happened before.

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,100
It's always been exactly the same.

83
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,110
I wonder what's up with it.

84
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,770
I have no idea.

85
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
And to be honest...

86
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,610
my father knew the secrets of the tablet better than I did.

87
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,030
Unfortunately, he swore he'd never reveal them.

88
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,330
He never did.

89
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,290
Whoa!

90
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
You Okay?

91
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,670
Yes.

92
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,840
Yes, I'm fine.

93
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,050
Just take it easy out there tonight, all right?

94
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,050
You got 15 minutes till showtime.

95
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,970
We're gonna figure this out tomorrow.

96
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,180
All right.

97
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,140
Look at that!

98
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,970
Doggonei?

99
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,220
Did you see that?

100
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,640
They're trying to catch the light.

101
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,850
But you can't do it, boys! You can't catch light!

102
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,480
It's as elusive as human happiness!

103
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,690
I should like to comment.

104
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,150
-Summon the apparatus. -Yeah.

105
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,070
Summon the apparatus!

106
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,370
What are you gonna say?

107
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,830
L...

108
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,000
O...

109
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,180
L...

110
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,100
"Laugh out loud." Yeah, that's what I did.

111
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,270
Now, post these adorable kittens

112
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,270
with my edict of approval to Facebook.

113
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,520
Give a big Texas "hell yeah" from old Jedediah...

114
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,770
because I loved it too!

115
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,070
Just send a smiley face.

116
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,190
Yeah, but with a wink!

117
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,610
A smiley face and a wink!

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Guys, what are you doing?

119
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,370
We're just watching kittens.

120
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,370
You're on in five minutes. You got to focus, here.

121
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,080
I told you we don't have time for this!

122
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,870
You gave it a Texas "hell yeah!"

123
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,580
Hey, Teddy, ready to roll?

124
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,670
Indeed, Lawrence.

125
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,000
-Great. -Battle of San Juan Hill cool as a cucumber.

126
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,090
Right now, butterflies like you wouldn't believe.

127
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,590
You're gonna be great.

128
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,670
-Lawrence? -Yeah.

129
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,090
Have you seen the Neanderthals lately?

130
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,890
No. Why does everybody keep talking about this?

131
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,430
You may want to give it a look!

132
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,690
Hey, guys, what's going on?

133
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,440
Ooh!

134
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,740
Okay.

135
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,160
All right, very funny.

136
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,910
That's hilarious.

137
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,410
You don't have to come down.

138
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,910
It's okay, really.

139
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,250
Hi, how are you? I'm Larry.

140
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm Lama...

141
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,250
You're "Laaa"?

142
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,250
Laaa.

143
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,130
Laaa. Okay, nice to meet you, Laaa.

144
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,760
Welcome aboard, and...

145
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes, we look similar.

146
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,760
Yeah, we look like each other, I know.

147
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,100
It's a joke that somebody played.

148
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,600
Dr. McPhee had you made to look like me.

149
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,770
It's just a...

150
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,360
Stop it. Stop, okay?

151
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,780
-Dada? -What?

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Dada.

153
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,950
No, not your Dada.

154
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,530
Yeah, Dada.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,820
-No. Stop. -Dada.

156
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,540
-Dada! -Dada!

157
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,620
No, I'm not his... I'm not your Dada.

158
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,540
Dum Dum got a new son-son!

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,830
No, he doesn't.

160
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,840
Dada!

161
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,670
Dada!

162
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,710
A toast to our new chairwoman.

163
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Cheers, everyone. Cheers.

164
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,640
Cue the music.

165
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,850
And Teddy in three, two...

166
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Since 1869, when I was a mere boy of 11...

167
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,160
this museum has been a shining beacon to our great city.

168
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,080
Tonight we'll expand our horizons even further...

169
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,330
to the Sun...

170
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,000
the Moon, and the stars.

171
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,330
From our very beginning...

172
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,340
mankind has looked to the heavens

173
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,670
and given names to what he saw.

174
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,510
The constellations.

175
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,430
I thought you might like to meet them.

176
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,840
Cue the constellations.

177
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,020
Wow.

178
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,200
Orion, the hunter!

179
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,920
What?

180
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,380
All planned. All planned.

181
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,220
I knew that was gonna happen. So, yeah.

182
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,600
Good. Going great, guys. Going great.

183
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,390
Let's drop the silks.

184
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,310
And go with the monkey.

185
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,690
What?

186
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,330
Come on.

187
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,760
That's what I do.

188
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,470
Thank you for your patronage...

189
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,270
and for your unwavering support of this fine institution.

190
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,520
This newly renovated planetarium will serve as a lens...

191
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,990
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends!"

192
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,780
What?

193
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,370
Charge!

194
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,130
Rough Riders!

195
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,500
-It's okay! Just hang on! -Is this part of it?

196
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,960
Sorry folks, a little technical issue.

197
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,210
What are you doing?

198
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,970
Stick to the script. Stick to the script! Huh?

199
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,140
-It's me! -I don't know you.

200
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,020
Pull!

201
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,820
I don't know what's come over me, but I like it!

202
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
Drop 'em!

203
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,160
Ha-ha!

204
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,490
Yeah! Yeah!

205
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,500
What's going on?

206
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,340
Do something!

207
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,060
oh!

208
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,230
What are you doing?

209
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,310
Ah!

210
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,450
Orion, don't!

211
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,410
Rexy!

212
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,550
Guys, what was going on out there?

213
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,600
Seriously, what were you thinking?

214
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,060
Laaa, I got this, all right?

215
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,140
Just "Go over there.

216
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,980
No, go over there.

217
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,150
Go.

218
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,610
Attila...

219
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,070
what were you doing to that dolphin, man?

220
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,150
It's a dolphin!

221
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,990
It's one of the most peaceful creatures on earth...

222
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,740
and you're hacking into it like it was The Cove or something.

223
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,120
Did you see the look on Regis Philbin's face?

224
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,160
Ream?

225
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,580
Yeah, Reeju.

226
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,960
Teddy, what were you doing pointing a gun at me?

227
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,340
Forgive me, Lawrence. I don't know what came over me.

228
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,920
Do you even remember that?

229
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,300
Not at all.

230
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,260
Laaa, shut that down! It's a defibrillator.

231
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,840
Put it down. It's dangerous!

232
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,760
Laaa, that's electricity. Those aren't headphones.

233
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,430
Stop it!

234
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,690
Oh! Hey! Whoa! Dexter!

235
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,980
What are you doing?

236
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,270
Huh?

237
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,690
Honestly, if you're gonna act like a baby,

238
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,820
then I'll get you some diapers.

239
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,110
You want diapers again? Huh?

240
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,610
Whoa! Whoa!

241
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,440
Ease up on the reins there, hoss.

242
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,110
Can't you see? He feels terrible!

243
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,820
Hell, we all do!

244
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,490
I don't know what's going on with everybody here...

245
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,040
but tonight was really weird. Really weird.

246
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,200
We feel awful.

247
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,960
Something took hold of us like an evil spell!

248
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,290
Yeah, like we just weren't ourselves.

249
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,220
-Hello? -Larry.

250
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,760
Hey, Dr. McPhee.

251
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,140
Yeah, hi. How's it going?

252
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,430
Uh, okay.

253
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,560
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

254
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,480
You know that sound of when you're hiding in a trash bin...

255
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,160
fearing for your life

256
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,940
because a Tyrannosaurus rex is using it as a Hacky Sack?

257
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,450
No. I don't know thatsound.

258
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,530
You don't know that sound? Oh, hold on one second.

259
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,870
That's the sound! That's the sound! It will haunt my dreams!

260
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,250
I'm sorry. Look, really, I'm sorry.

261
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,750
I swear to you, I had no idea this was going to happen.

262
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,840
"I had no idea it was gonna happen.

263
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,750
"I'm only in charge of all the special effects."

264
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
It was your fault! They were your special effects!

265
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,840
-No, I know. -That's a joke.

266
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,850
"Special effects"? More like "special...

267
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,810
"defects!"

268
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,810
Look, I promise you, I'm gonna find out what happened.

269
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,640
Or they were "special rejects!"

270
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,980
I'm sorry, Dr. McPhee. I gotta go.

271
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,950
Hey!

272
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,070
Nicky! Nicky!

273
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,740
Stop hopping!

274
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
Dad, what are you doing?

275
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,830
What are you doing?

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,500
It's 3:00 am.

277
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,120
All right, party's over!

278
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,710
-Hey... -Hey...

279
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,340
Who are you?

280
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,800
-I'm Sophie. -Sophie?

281
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Bye Bye Birdie?

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,340
-Right. -It was good.

283
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
-Thanks. -Yeah.

284
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,630
See you tomorrow night?

285
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,970
-Probably not. -Probably.

286
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,090
Definitely not.

287
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,510
Bye.

288
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,470
You're in so much trouble.

289
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,230
I know.

290
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,980
I didn't really know you were coming home early.

291
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,310
Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

292
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,650
Imean...

293
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,780
what makes you think this is okay?

294
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,280
When I'm not at Mom's you leave me alone, like, every night.

295
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,160
Look, you can't be doing this right now.

296
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,910
You got finals, your NYU application is due in what, two weeks?

297
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm not gonna get into NYU.

298
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,870
-You don't know that. -No, I do.

299
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,160
You don't know that.

300
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,000
I do very much know that, in the sense that I don't intend to apply.

301
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,210
What?

302
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,750
I don't think that it's the place for me right now, Dad.

303
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,380
Okay. All right, fine. You want to spread your wings a little...

304
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,680
get out of the city, go to school somewhere else.

305
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,140
I totally support that. All you had to do was tell me.

306
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Where do you want to go?

307
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,220
-What's the list? -It's a short list.

308
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,430
Great. I like it. Focus.

309
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,560
I'mma hit you with a super short list, man, becauseifs

310
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,060
There's nothing on it.

311
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,610
There's...

312
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,820
I'm confused, because there's not a list...

313
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Dad?

314
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,530
Mmm-hmm?

315
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,030
I want to take a year off.

316
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,950
I would like to do exactly what you just said.

317
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,660
I want to spread my wings.

318
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,080
You want to spread your wings, that's great.

319
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,620
But you can't spread your wings and fly to nowhere.

320
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,420
-Plans change. -No, they don't.

321
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,210
No, they don't. Plans don't change.

322
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,540
We had a plan, itchanged.

323
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,050
-It's disorienting at first. -No.

324
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,300
You can't change the plan...

325
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,340
unless you check with the people who are financing the plan...

326
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,430
which is, last time I checked,

327
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,970
your mother and I. Okay?

328
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,220
Dad, we could sit here and just have this conversation about plans...

329
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,810
but for now, let's call it a night.

330
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,390
Let's not even clean up, right?

331
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,640
Let's come back tomorrow.

332
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,060
Let's reboot the whole energy,

333
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,520
the whole tone of this puppy...

334
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,650
and we'll kill it, man.

335
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,270
Team Daley! Not tonight, tomorrow.

336
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Hey, Team Daley?

337
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,570
-Yeah? -Stop talking.

338
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,650
Okay.

339
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,070
You're gonna clean up. I'm gonna go to bed.

340
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,700
And then we're gonna finish this conversation tomorrow.

341
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,090
Yeah! Get some!

342
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,170
Get some!

343
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,140
That's it. Yeah.

344
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,010
Hi.

345
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,350
I'm Larry Daley. I'm head of the Night Program.

346
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,230
I know who you are. You're the security guard.

347
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,100
Yeah, also head of the Night Program.

348
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,850
I'm doing some research...

349
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,270
and I was wondering if you could help me out.

350
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,440
Mmm. Night guard doing research.

351
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,990
Ooh la-la!

352
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,400
Yeah.

353
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,990
Uh, I'm just looking for anything

354
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,870
that you might have on the tablet of Ahkmenrah.

355
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,990
Center aisle.

356
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,330
-Great. -Halfway down, stacks on your left.

357
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,290
Get it!

358
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,970
So...

359
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,520
what makes you so curious about the tablet?

360
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,350
Oh! Just, uh...

361
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,270
Just a hobby, you know? Kind of an interest of mine.

362
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,770
I wish I could talk to these guys.

363
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,480
Well, you can't.

364
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,570
Yeah.

365
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,990
Because they're dead.

366
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,070
Right.

367
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,410
But, uh, look at that one.

368
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,910
Looks like a kid, huh?

369
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,380
You didn't know him, did you?

370
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
C.J Fredericks.

371
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,550
He worked here.

372
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,630
-He worked here? -Yeah, when he grew up.

373
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,880
-No. -Yeah.

374
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,840
He was a night guard.

375
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,300
Same as you.

376
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,310
Wait a minute. C.J.

377
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,930
C.J Fredericks.

378
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,640
Cecil Fredericks?

379
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,480
Sexiest night guard we ever had.

380
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,480
Present company included.

381
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,740
Boy, could that man move.

382
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,510
Larry?

383
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,670
Hey, Cecil.

384
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,680
My God, it's been years!

385
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,260
You look like you're doing pretty good.

386
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,350
I've still got it, pal.

387
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,600
What are you doing here?

388
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,350
I need to talk to you about the tablet.

389
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,310
What the heck is Short Stack doing here?

390
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,400
Hey, Gus. You're looking well.

391
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,610
Reginald.

392
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,110
Are you here to frame us again?

393
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,820
Send us back to the slammer?

394
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,950
I didn't frame you. You were actually stealing.

395
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,910
And I was the one that got you out of jail, so...

396
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,080
-Yeah. -We've got a nice life here.

397
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,330
The past is the past. We've moved on.

398
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,620
I don't think this guy's moved on.

399
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,460
Listen to him, monkey face.

400
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,040
We've put all that tablet stuff behind us, Larry.

401
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,290
It's old news.

402
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,250
Besides, we really never knew anything about that old tablet.

403
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,710
We just worked there.

404
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,420
Something's up with it.

405
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,010
I told you, I can't help you.

406
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,510
Maybe this kid can.

407
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,850
Maybe we'd better talk alone.

408
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,650
Expedition like that is a pretty amazing thing...

409
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,280
for a 12-year-old boy.

410
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
I tried to move on...

411
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,240
but there was something about that tablet.

412
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,990
It's turning green, like some sort of corrosion.

413
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,410
And something's happening to Teddy and Dexter...

414
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,620
Jed and Octavius.

415
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,380
They're all acting weird.

416
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,960
It's like the green rust is affecting them.

417
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,800
"The end will come."

418
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,050
What?

419
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,470
The locals, they warned us.

420
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,270
They begged us to leave that tomb alone.

421
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,520
I thought it meant the end of the world.

422
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,100
But maybe it meant the end...

423
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,770
End of the magic?

424
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
We should have listened.

425
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,320
Should have listened.

426
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,570
Instead, we shipped Ahk and the tablet off to New York...

427
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,570
and his folks to England.

428
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,990
Wait. Wait.

429
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,910
Ahkmenrah's parents are in England?

430
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,910
It was a joint expedition.

431
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,330
Some of the artifacts stayed in Egypt.

432
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,290
The rest was divided up between New York and the British Museum.

433
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,300
Ahk said that his father knew the secrets of the tablet.

434
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,220
I think I have to go talk to him.

435
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,050
I need you to listen to me. Uh...

436
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,310
Our esteemed chairwoman asked for my resignation.

437
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,770
She said, since the Night Program was my brainchild...

438
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,480
that the buck starts and stops with me.

439
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,610
-I can fix it. -How?

440
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,980
I need you to let me take the tablet and Ahkmenrah to London.

441
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,150
Sorry. I'm just processing that.

442
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,910
Input data analysis.

443
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,620
I've just told you I'm being fired,

444
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,040
and the first thing you ask...

445
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,120
is if I'd allow you to take some priceless artifacts...

446
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,370
away with you on holiday.

447
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,830
-Yes. Please. -No way, Jose.

448
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,630
I'm asking you to please go with me on this.

449
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
-Nah. -Please.

450
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,760
Can't do it, dude.

451
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,050
Bye.

452
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,760
-Are you gonna mug me? -What?

453
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,350
I don't know. Just be prepared.

454
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
-I need you to listen to me. -Oh.

455
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
-Okay? -Yep.

456
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,310
-You want to know the truth? -Go on.

457
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,610
Truth is, the tablet...

458
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,150
The tablet is actually magic.

459
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,070
Things really do come to life at night.

460
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,610
-It's special effects. -It's not special effects.

461
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,820
How could it be special effects?

462
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,910
How could it not be special effects?

463
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,490
-Because it isn't! -Of course it is!

464
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,950
-I'm telling you, this is what happens. -What?

465
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,000
Sun goes down...

466
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,750
the tablet starts to glow...

467
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,340
everything comes to life.

468
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,630
-Sure. -It's real.

469
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,170
"Tablet starts to glow."

470
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,180
Now I know you're mental.

471
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,470
Look, Leslie

472
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Listen to me. I'm not gonna hurt you.

473
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,600
I know. Just...

474
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,430
What?

475
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,960
Listen, nobody cares

476
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,020
about this place as much as we do, right?

477
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,270
Yeah.

478
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
If you don't help me...

479
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,440
everything that's special about it might stop...

480
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,450
and it may never come back.

481
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,780
I'm not asking you to understand,

482
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,200
I'm just asking you to trust me.

483
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,790
I'd like to help you...

484
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,380
but I don't even work here anymore.

485
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,920
British Museum doesn't know that.

486
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,130
The mummy and the tablet, both.

487
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,050
Classic conservation job...

488
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,890
under authority of me, of course...

489
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,970
the director of this museum, which I still am.

490
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,480
Yep, okay.

491
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
You're in.

492
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,930
I really could have just stayed by myself in New York.

493
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,390
Yeah. No, that wasn't gonna happen.

494
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,970
-Beautiful, huh? -Yeah.

495
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,310
The River Thames.

496
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,180
Isn't this cool, man, you and me in London?

497
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,690
-Huh? -Yeah.

498
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,560
Hey, I've been thinking about that, uh, year off.

499
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
Yeah?

500
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,570
I think it could be cool.

501
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,990
-Yeah? -Yeah.

502
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,530
What are you thinking?

503
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,200
Yeah. Uh... Wow.

504
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,830
I think I want to DJ in Ibiza.

505
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,000
In Ibiza?

506
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,670
Ibiza, it's a small island off the coast of Spain.

507
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,580
-Do you speak Spanish? -No.

508
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,710
But that's the beautiful thing. It's about the music.

509
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,710
It's not inhibited by the language barrier.

510
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,760
No, but you are.

511
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,170
-Do you speak in beats? -Why are you freaking out?

512
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,840
You just said this was a really cool idea.

513
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,010
I'm not freaking out.

514
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,850
I just want to understand what the plan is.

515
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,760
You didn't go to college.

516
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,980
Wait, now we're talking about not going to college at all?

517
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,480
-Maybe. I don't know. -Nicky.

518
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,600
Nicky. That's not...

519
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,570
Dad, you didn't go to college. You turned out fine.

520
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,990
I turned out okay after about 20 years in a lot of dead ends.

521
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,700
Whatever, man.

522
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,910
Don't worry about me. It's fine.

523
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,530
Hey, I'm always gonna worry about you.

524
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,870
-I'm your dad. -Thanks.

525
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,790
Sun is going down. We should get going.

526
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,870
All right.

527
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,050
Dad, what's the plan here, anyway?

528
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,720
When the tablet brings Ahkmenrah to life, he's gonna sneak us in.

529
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,890
-Now, get down. -What?

530
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,850
Just get down! Come on, man. Part of the adventure.

531
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,440
Hello. Welcome to the British Museum.

532
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,530
My name's Tilly.

533
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,820
Hi. Thank you.

534
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,110
I'm Larry Daley from Natural History, New York.

535
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,620
-Yeah, yeah. -I got a delivery...

536
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,580
for your conservation department.

537
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,410
All right!

538
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,000
So they let you travel?

539
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,250
This is kind of unusual.

540
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,630
Well, they let me travel. You know where?

541
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,130
-No. -Home. Here. Home.

542
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,920
Back here.

543
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,760
Off to the toot-toot.

544
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,550
Five-minute maximum.

545
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,760
So that must be well wicked being a security guard in America.

546
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,640
Uh... With your gun, with a silencer,

547
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,730
with your ninja swords.

548
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,890
Right.

549
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,690
That's not even a little bit true.

550
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,110
The only thing that I got is this.

551
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,780
-Oh. -Hammer! It's for...

552
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,320
and I quote, "minor repairs and beautifications"

553
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,700
to the shack.

554
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,080
Oh...

555
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,370
You just hit things?

556
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,040
Yeah, that's catchy.

557
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,580
Basically worthless.

558
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,250
I can't believe we're actually still talking.

559
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,090
-It's great, though, innit? -It is.

560
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,000
This is the most conversation I've had

561
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,710
in the three years that I've worked here.

562
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,680
I feel a connection, too.

563
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,970
Is it cool if I just make my drop?

564
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,850
-Oh, yeah. -Wonderful.

565
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,560
But I will have to confirm.

566
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,980
Actually, that's not necessary...

567
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,940
because they've already confirmed it on the slip I gave you.

568
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,770
Yeah, all right. Confirming.

569
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,520
-Okay. -All right.

570
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,240
Hello. This is Dr. McPhee.

571
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,070
It's the British Museum, sir.

572
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,280
I'm just confirming a delivery to our conservation department.

573
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,080
Yes, I signed the paperwork.

574
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,160
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a museum to run.

575
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,460
You, boy, get those grubby fingers off my Ming vase.

576
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,210
See? Bye.

577
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,710
All right.

578
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,840
-Good? -All right, you is legit.

579
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,460
I is legit.

580
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,130
-Wonderful. -Confirm it.

581
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,800
-Thank you. -All right, I'll open the gate.

582
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,890
Okay.

583
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,680
Yeah, so, like, my boyfriend...

584
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,560
he doesn't really like the way I do my hair.

585
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,350
Says it looks like a golden poo sitting on my shoulder.

586
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
-But I really enjoy it. -Mmm-hmm.

587
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,940
Bye, Larry!

588
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,280
I'm not an expert...

589
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,070
but this is feeling, just, really against the law.

590
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,660
No, they have a totally different legal system here.

591
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,330
Okay.

592
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,500
How we doing?

593
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
All clear.

594
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,040
All right, let's go.

595
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,460
Larry, the others felt, perhaps, we could use some help.

596
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
The others?

597
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,710
Lawrence, I couldn't sit idly by.

598
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,420
Our very survival is at stake.

599
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,470
All right. Hey, Teddy. Good.

600
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,300
Good man to have in a crisis.

601
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,090
Attila.

602
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,600
Okay, a little muscle.

603
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,430
Hi, Larry.

604
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,060
That is a deceptively large box.

605
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,230
Obviously, we came along, too!

606
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,310
You know you'd be lost without us, Gigantor.

607
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,730
Are you serious?

608
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,030
And the monkey. All right, basically everyone.

609
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,450
Dada!

610
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,490
Oh! No, no.

611
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,740
No possible benefit whatsoever.

612
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,620
He really wanted to come.

613
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,790
Yeah, this is my son...

614
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,420
my actual son, Nicky.

615
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,920
-Nicky, this is Laaa. -What's up?

616
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,300
He's just tracking me.

617
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,760
Laaa.

618
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,550
So, Lawrence...

619
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,800
what's the plan of attack?

620
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,720
We need to get to the Egyptian wing, find Ahk's father...

621
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,560
and hopefully get the tablet fixed. Huh?

622
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,060
All of us.

623
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,820
Laaa, that's not for eating. That's not food.

624
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,030
Don't...

625
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,070
You know what? I got a job for you.

626
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,320
Come on, come on.

627
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,870
Come on.

628
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,870
I want you to stay here and watch this door, okay?

629
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,380
Make sure nobody comes in or out. Okay?

630
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,250
Good. You're gonna be a guard, just like me.

631
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,960
All right.

632
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,670
No. Come here.

633
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,420
Stay here...

634
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,550
and put your hands on the door.

635
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,760
-Good, stay. -Stay!

636
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,640
Good. That's right. You stay here.

637
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,970
Stay here.

638
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,390
Stay. Right.

639
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,680
No. Stay.

640
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,020
-Stay! -Stay.

641
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,850
Look there. Good. Stay.

642
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,690
No. Good. Stay.

643
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,190
No. Stay.

644
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,480
Stay!

645
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,110
Don't... Don't move.

646
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,240
Don't move.

647
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,490
No. Good. Okay.

648
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,290
Okay, listen up, guys.

649
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,910
This place is waking up for the first time...

650
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,710
and we have no idea what's out there, so stay together, all right?

651
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,090
I know it's spooky, big guy.

652
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,170
Just stay close.

653
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,730
What kind of haunted hootenanny is this, boys?

654
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,490
We're all finding this super creepy, right?

655
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,780
They're just a little freaked out.

656
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,120
First time we came alive it took some getting used to.

657
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,960
Hey, there. Just heading to Egypt.

658
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,420
Come on. This way.

659
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,480
Hear that?

660
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,810
Hear what?

661
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,650
That.

662
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,650
We'll just be down here if anyone needs us.

663
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,110
We're not scared. It's just more comfortable.

664
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,370
Lawrence...

665
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,160
I think it's safe to say that we're in a bit of trouble.

666
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,950
I know how to handle this guy.

667
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,370
You mind?

668
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,370
Thanks.

669
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,130
What are you doing?

670
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,000
How do you think I tamed your pal Rexy?

671
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,010
Hi, there.

672
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,680
I bet you're not so mean, are you? Huh?

673
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,720
I bet you're not so mean.

674
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,180
No, you're just a little puppy, right?

675
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,180
You're just a little puppy who wants to play.

676
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,020
You want to play, huh?

677
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,230
Want to play fetch?

678
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,400
Yeah?

679
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,060
You want to play with this bone?

680
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,230
Ah! Yeah!

681
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,400
Here you go. Go fetch.

682
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,150
Go fetch!

683
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,450
-Lawrence? -Yeah?

684
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,710
-May I suggest a different plan? -What?

685
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,000
Run!

686
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,430
Close it, close it!

687
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,320
Okay. I think we're...

688
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,740
Get back! Everybody, get back!

689
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,710
All right. You don't want to fetch?

690
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,420
-Fetch on this. -What?

691
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,430
Oh! Oh!Ah!

692
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,010
-Oh, that's close! -Need some help?

693
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,760
-What? -Move.

694
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,780
Whoa!

695
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,370
Attila, you okay?

696
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,370
Whoa.

697
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,910
Oh!

698
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,800
-You might want to... -No.

699
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,970
Here...

700
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,350
hold this.

701
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,400
That was actually very cool.

702
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,070
Sir Lancelot, at your service.

703
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,740
Thank you. That was amazing.

704
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,150
Theodore Roosevelt...

705
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
President of the United States of America.

706
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,200
I have no idea what that means.

707
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,780
I'm Larry, and this is my son, Nick.

708
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,410
You have a noble face, Nick.

709
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,660
-Thanks. -Thanks for the help.

710
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,830
Now, you...

711
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,040
You remind me of a man I once knew at Camelot.

712
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,210
Really?

713
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,380
One of the Knights of the Round Table?

714
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,550
No, Erik.

715
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Erik?

716
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,970
Our fool.

717
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,300
He was the funniest fool I ever met.

718
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,430
He was so good, he didn't even have to do anything.

719
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,810
He could just walk into a room and you'd laugh.

720
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,310
Hmm.

721
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,600
-You have what he had. The gift. -That's weird.

722
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,610
-You could be a fool. -I don't know about that.

723
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,900
Oh, come on, of course you could!

724
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,940
We'd get you one of those hats with the funny little dangly bells.

725
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,490
Dangly bells?

726
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,280
Hmm?

727
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,990
"Dangly bells."

728
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,910
Didn't I tell you? The gift.

729
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,200
He does what seems like nothing.

730
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,710
A sort of deadpan...

731
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,210
tiny little...

732
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,330
"Hmm." "Hmm."

733
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,590
Expressionless, you know, sort of a...

734
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,920
"Hmm. Hmm."

735
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
sort of thing.

736
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,550
Just like Erik.

737
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,010
Sounds like a great guy. We got to get going, so...

738
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,180
Ah, Camelot.

739
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Okay.

740
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,510
Someday, I shall return to its mighty towers...

741
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,220
to King Arthur...

742
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,270
and Queen Guinevere.

743
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,440
Sweet...

744
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,270
beauteous Guinevere.

745
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,270
But I'm sworn not to until I have completed my quest.

746
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,110
I must find the Holy Grail.

747
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,030
Well, good luck with that.

748
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,360
And thanks for the help again.

749
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,030
We got to get to Egypt, so we'll see you.

750
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,410
-I will lead you. -No, it's okay.

751
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,120
Halt, Dangly Bells!

752
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,080
There is strange magic in the air,

753
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,000
and dangerous beasts are afoot.

754
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,040
It is the duty of a true knight...

755
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,670
to protect and care for those in need.

756
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
We're off.

757
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,420
I guess he's coming with us.

758
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,840
Larry!

759
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,640
Jed and Octavius?

760
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,930
They must have fallen out while we were running.

761
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,060
Jed?

762
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,690
Octavius!

763
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,650
Jedediah!

764
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,780
-Jed! -Octo!

765
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,320
Oh, no.

766
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,160
Is that Octavius's cape?

767
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Here.

768
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,090
-Nicky. -Yeah.

769
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,050
Guys?

770
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,510
Gigantor!

771
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,930
Jed?

772
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,230
They won't last long in those heating vents, Lawrence.

773
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,730
At their size, they'll bake like tiny little scarabs in the Sinai.

774
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,940
Too dark?

775
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,950
Ah!

776
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,010
This is the end, boy!

777
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,640
This is the last roundup!

778
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,020
Hold my hand!

779
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,810
Why?

780
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,270
Never mind.

781
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,410
We're a long way from home, boy.

782
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,670
Did you ask me to hold your hand?

783
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,000
No.

784
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,220
Mmm-hmm.

785
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,260
Jedo!

786
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,840
Octo!

787
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,680
They could be anywhere between here and the intake vent.

788
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,150
What do you see, Dex?

789
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,610
You know he's a monkey, Lawrence.

790
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,730
He can't talk.

791
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,240
No, but he can fit.

792
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,030
Nicky... give me your phone.

793
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,780
-Why? -For Dex.

794
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,040
I don't understand one thing that's going on here.

795
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,750
Idon%, eHhen Dad, what's going on?

796
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,750
I'm sort of set up to track your phone.

797
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,290
You're sort of set up to track my phone? You track my phone?

798
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,050
Yeah, I'm your dad. I'm looking out for you.

799
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,210
No. No. Hold up.

800
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,470
"Spying on" is not the same thing

801
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,010
as just looking out for someone.

802
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,430
You'll get it back, I promise.

803
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,050
But right now, it's going on the monkey's back.

804
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,720
All right. Dex, come here.

805
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,980
Thanks, man.

806
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,770
Listen. I need you to go down there and find them, all right?

807
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,520
Think you can handle it?

808
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,860
Good man.

809
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,070
Stay safe.

810
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,800
I think it's right here.

811
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,720
"Right here."

812
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,140
Classic.

813
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,600
Ah, the gift of laughter.

814
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,730
Thank you, Dangly Bells.

815
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,410
First quest?

816
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,330
Uh, not exactly.

817
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,040
Ithoughtyou were going to Egypt.

818
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,000
We are, but we got to do this first.

819
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,420
That's not how a quest works.

820
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,500
A quest is one thing. It's not, like, "Holy Grail and a monkey."

821
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,170
Yeah, well, my guys are missing

822
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,340
and Dexter's gonna find them.

823
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,760
What is the quest? Gold?

824
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,220
Fountain of Youth?

825
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,510
Magic tablet.

826
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,520
It's that thing Ahk is holding.

827
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,770
It shouldn't be too hard to take it from him.

828
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,690
He seems well-toned andleanu.

829
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,480
But weak.

830
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,070
It would be like taking candy from a feeble Egyptian baby.

831
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,950
No, we're not trying to take it, we're trying to fix it.

832
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,700
There's something wrong with it.

833
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,490
It's kind of complicated.

834
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,580
It might be less complicated if you stopped following a chimpanzee.

835
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,830
He's not a chimpanzee, he's a capuchin.

836
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,830
The fool seems agitated.

837
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,210
That's often his way.

838
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,050
But I assure you, he's no fool.

839
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,880
Is it true what he says?

840
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,760
The tablet that you carry is magic?

841
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,140
It is, indeed.

842
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,510
Everything around you has come to life tonight

843
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,180
for the very first time...

844
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,730
all because of this tablet.

845
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,070
Amazing.

846
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,360
Then they're not real?

847
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,490
They're as real as any of us.

848
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,320
Yes, but we're real people.

849
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,700
They're just things.

850
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,990
And they don't even know.

851
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,290
They must be unbelievably stupid.

852
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,080
It can be confusing at first.

853
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,130
Hello, frog!

854
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,420
Keep hopping!

855
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,840
You're real!

856
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,380
Guys, I think we're gonna have to cut through Asia.

857
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:19,970
Not a clue.

858
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,220
None.

859
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,190
I can't really see much.

860
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,650
We could jump down, hope for the best.

861
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,440
But we have no idea what's down there.

862
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,530
We don't know what's up here, either.

863
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,260
This is a Roman city.

864
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,350
I can feel the familiar pull of history in its very foundations.

865
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,560
Where the heck is everybody?

866
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,810
I've seen this town before, I'm sure of it.

867
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,560
Romans?

868
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,820
I see you have the name of a lady on your arm.

869
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,910
Andrea. Yeah.

870
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,460
So this Lady Andrea is your Guinevere.

871
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,250
Does any man stand between you and your ladylove?

872
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,170
Yeah, actually. My dad kind of messed things up the other night.

873
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,170
-Nick. -Oh, we're stopping.

874
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,630
Let no man stand between you and your destiny.

875
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,640
Oh, "destiny" may be overstating it a bit.

876
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,260
We just have calculus together.

877
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,680
It's more one of those...

878
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,350
fleeting moments of eye contact.

879
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,600
"Who's gonna look away first?"

880
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,060
But I get you. No man...

881
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,480
-Good. -Okay.

882
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,700
"Iiepwop."

883
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,620
"Iiepwop."

884
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,160
Doesn't ring a bell.

885
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,580
Now who's this son of a gun?

886
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,630
-Pompeii! -I'm sorry.

887
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,960
-I'm having trouble hearing you! -Pompeii!

888
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,880
No comprendo, amigo...

889
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,880
because you got the thing in front of you!

890
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,510
What are they doing?

891
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,930
Where in the blazes are they stampeding off to?

892
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,270
Was it something we said?

893
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,480
Come on back to liepwop!

894
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,690
-There's plenty of room! -Come on back!

895
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,820
They're as crazy as road lizards.

896
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,900
People are strange.

897
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,370
Oh.

898
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,830
Hey, guy-We're just passing through.

899
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,330
-It's a Garuda from Tibet. -A Garuda?

900
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,250
Hi, Garuda. How you doing?

901
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,670
Garuda! How you doing?

902
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,750
Cool, great.

903
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,340
Okay. We just...

904
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,670
You know what? We just got to get through. I don't have time.

905
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,760
Please. Okay.

906
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,890
I'm not gonna play this game with you.

907
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,220
I got to go through. Really.

908
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,530
Get back.

909
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,040
-A dragon. -No, it's not a dragon. It's a...

910
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,790
It's a Xiangliu.

911
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,870
Mythical snake demon.

912
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,960
It looks like a dragon. I say we kill it.

913
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,960
What? No, it's asleep.

914
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,220
You're right. It's not very sporting to kill it while it's asleep.

915
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,760
Let's wake it up and then kill it.

916
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,640
I shall go first, and I shall take the boy.

917
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,680
What are you...? No! You're not gonna take the boy.

918
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,680
-Why not? -Because he's a boy!

919
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,470
Larry, there comes a time in every man's life...

920
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,060
when he must slay his own dragon.

921
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,350
Not this kid, all right?

922
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,690
He still hasn't finished all his thank-you notes from his bar mitzvah.

923
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,650
Anyway, that's just an expression.

924
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:02,730
Not where I come from.

925
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,650
He's not gonna slay his dragon right now.

926
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,150
We're gonna go around it.

927
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,150
We're gonna go around now, or else we're gonna lose the signal.

928
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Come on.

929
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,120
Iiepwop.

930
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,540
Pompeii!

931
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,540
Liepwop. Are you sure you're reading that right, pal?

932
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,630
Hmm?

933
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,590
Pompeii!

934
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,230
Oh!

935
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:40,850
"Pompeii."

936
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,240
"Ask not what your country can do for you...

937
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,040
"Ask what you can do for your country."

938
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:05,840
There it goes again!

939
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,550
-Attila! -Shh!

940
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,430
-Teddy! -Charge!

941
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,470
Whoa!

942
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Fantastic!

943
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,600
It's awake!

944
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:23,770
Now we can kill it!

945
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,740
Whoa!

946
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,410
-Attila! -Dad!

947
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,540
Nicky!

948
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,250
I'll get the boy!

949
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,550
-Ever used a blade? -Only in World of Warcraft!

950
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,760
You're about to learn.

951
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,490
"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!"

952
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,290
"Doing a heck of a job, Brownie."

953
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,230
Behind you!

954
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,490
Duck!

955
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,410
Last roundup, kemosabe!

956
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,910
Time to slap on the barbecue sauce, boy!

957
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Huh? What?

958
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,310
No, no! You wouldn't!

959
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,140
He must!

960
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,030
Clear!

961
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,140
We must never speak of what happened here today.

962
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,060
Come on! That wasn't necessary!

963
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,180
It's out!

964
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,810
These things really do save lives.

965
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,530
Are you all right?

966
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,490
Are you all right, my dear?

967
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,040
-You okay? -Yeah, thanks.

968
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,460
You fought bravely, sire.

969
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,420
One day, I promise you,

970
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
we shall drink dragon's blood from the victor's cup.

971
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,550
I'm good with just, like, soda or water, too.

972
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,720
But I like the energy we got going.

973
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,430
From now on, you must choose your own path.

974
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,810
And let no man tell you otherwise.

975
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,560
We better let Larry know we're okay.

976
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,940
Turn around.

977
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,940
Larry's probably worried about us.

978
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,000
How are we going to find them now?

979
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,670
Lawrence?

980
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,920
I fear we've turned a corner.

981
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,710
I'm becoming wax again, son.

982
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,170
All right. We'll look for them later.

983
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,050
We got to get to Egypt now.

984
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,260
Wait, shouldn't we keep looking for Jed and Octavius?

985
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,600
Nick is right.

986
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,930
A true knight never shirks his duties.

987
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,310
If we don't get to Egypt soon we're not gonna save anybody.

988
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,860
Dada say, "Stay!"

989
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,490
Stay!

990
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,630
Dada say Laaa no eat.

991
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,760
Stay, Laaa!

992
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,360
This is it.

993
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,990
Perhaps I should accompany you in.

994
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,200
No, I think we got it from here.

995
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,410
-Really? -Yeah. No, we're good.

996
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,660
Right. Well...

997
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,040
friends...

998
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
Larry...

999
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,910
clown-faced keeper of the magic tablet...

1000
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,210
I shall never forget your bravery.

1001
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,330
Nor your jests.

1002
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,840
Bye.

1003
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,590
I shall not say goodbye.

1004
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,710
-I am. -What?

1005
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,180
I'm gonna say goodbye. I have to go, I'm sorry.

1006
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,430
I'll see you.

1007
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,100
Really, man, thank you.

1008
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,510
For everything.

1009
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,520
I haven't seen these walls for many a moon.

1010
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,320
Ahkmen?

1011
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,900
Mother.

1012
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,990
Oh!

1013
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:15,830
Father.

1014
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,000
Welcome home, my son.

1015
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,300
I want you to meet my friends.

1016
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,430
I am Merenkahre...

1017
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,770
Pharaoh of the Nile and Father to the Son of the Sun.

1018
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,140
And I am Shepseheret...

1019
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,810
the Glittering Jewel of the Nine Kingdoms.

1020
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,770
And I am Larry.

1021
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,190
Guardian of Brooklyn.

1022
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,480
Yes.

1023
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,280
I actually live in Manhattan now.

1024
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,240
I know, but it doesn't sound as cool.

1025
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,530
Yeah.

1026
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,450
We would be very honored if you could take a look at the tablet.

1027
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,700
There's something happening with it.

1028
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,080
We don't understand what it is.

1029
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,710
You are speaking with a pharaoh.

1030
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,460
Kiss my staff.

1031
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,260
Is it okay if I don't?

1032
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,840
You will show respect.

1033
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,550
I am the descendant of Ra, the sun god.

1034
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,810
I understand that and I totally respect you.

1035
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,220
I just don't pray to Ra, so...

1036
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,980
The Egyptian gods are the only true gods.

1037
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,900
Well, we try to stay a little more open-minded.

1038
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,780
I mean, Sacajawea, she honors her spiritual ancestors...

1039
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,490
and you pray to some sort of goat god, Attila?

1040
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,320
I'm half-Irish, half-Jewish...

1041
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,280
You are? I love Jews!

1042
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,370
We owned 40, 000 of them!

1043
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,700
-Such lovely people. -Here we go.

1044
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:39,420
They were very happy, always singing with the candles.

1045
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,790
Yeah. They really weren't happy.

1046
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,840
-Really? -No. They left.

1047
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,670
They spent about 40 years in the desert trying to escape.

1048
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,800
Oh!

1049
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,590
Yeah. We have dinner once a year and talk about it.

1050
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,380
It's a big deal for us.

1051
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,720
Listen, could you take a look at that tablet?

1052
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,760
There's something wrong with it.

1053
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,810
It's losing its power.

1054
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,360
Do you think you could fix it?

1055
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,650
To do that, I would have to divulge the secret of the tablet.

1056
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,610
I promise we won't tell anybody.

1057
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,700
No.

1058
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:14,700
I'll kiss your staff.

1059
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,790
Too late.

1060
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:20,790
Father, why do you insist on keeping this to yourself?

1061
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,340
The secret was to be passed down to you at the proper time.

1062
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,340
Well, it has been 4, 000 years.

1063
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,300
Now seems like a good time.

1064
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,510
You were born at midnight.

1065
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,640
I was Pharaoh...

1066
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,350
and I had seen wonders most men only dream of.

1067
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,310
But when I first gazed upon you...

1068
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,020
you were instantly more precious to me...

1069
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,400
than all the wonders of the ancient world.

1070
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,700
I knew I could never bear to say goodbye.

1071
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:57,990
I commanded the High Priest to create a gift to you, my son...

1072
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,080
using all we had learned of the mysteries of the afterlife.

1073
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,330
Forged in the temple of Khonsu, god of the moon...

1074
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,840
and watcher over nighttime travelers...

1075
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,430
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

1076
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:17,510
Our tomb was designed to channel Khonsu's rays down to the tablet...

1077
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,430
rejuvenating its powers every night.

1078
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,310
The moon god bestowed his power upon the tablet...

1079
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,400
so that, as long as it bathed in his light...

1080
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,690
our family could be together forever,

1081
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,240
and not even death could part us.

1082
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,780
It's been away from Khonsu's light toolong.

1083
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,460
My Son!

1084
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,500
What is happening to you?

1085
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:52,720
It needs moonlight...

1086
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,930
otherwise we shall all be dead by sunrise.

1087
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,430
Hurry!

1088
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,640
If the tablet dies...

1089
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,180
nothing can bring it back!

1090
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,240
What are you doing?

1091
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,910
The tablet. Now.

1092
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,790
Wait, listen to me. That thing is dying.

1093
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,420
If it doesn't get moonlight...

1094
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,460
everything ends, like, for real.

1095
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,840
King Arthur wasted years searching for the Holy Grail.

1096
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,710
To think it was a tablet all along.

1097
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,670
Would you just give it to me? You don't know what you're doing!

1098
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,300
My quest is complete.

1099
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,760
I ride for Camelot tonight.

1100
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,220
Just keep it, okay?

1101
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,550
Butjust put it in the moonlight

1102
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,930
and turn that center piece.

1103
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,890
Sorry, not my first quest.

1104
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:49,100
And by the way, Erik was much funnier than you!

1105
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,070
Go get the others.

1106
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,230
We can't let him leave the building!

1107
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,870
Whoa! Easy there, partner! Slow it down!

1108
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,370
I don't know who you are...

1109
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,210
but I'm pretty dang sure that tablet don't belong to you.

1110
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:13,710
Now wait a second!

1111
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,010
Come back here! This ain't over!

1112
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:19,010
You'll rue the day you mocked us with your huge sword

1113
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,180
and hypnotic blue eyes!

1114
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:24,930
His eyes are very blue.

1115
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,770
Speak softly and carry a big stick.

1116
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,860
Lawrence, we have a problem.

1117
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:41,950
This one turned to wax as well.

1118
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,160
I have a saying, too.

1119
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,200
"Speak loudly and carry a bigger stick."

1120
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,060
-It's over there! -You mean up there.

1121
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,400
Come on.

1122
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,280
Got it.

1123
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,870
-Teddy. -The tablet, now!

1124
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,120
I shan't ask you again, fool!

1125
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,670
And this is giving me a headache!

1126
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,540
Give me the tablet!

1127
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:36,710
Let me go, Lawrence.

1128
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,510
No! Teddy, no!

1129
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,670
Teddy!

1130
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,560
There.

1131
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,610
That'll be mine.

1132
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,040
Hey, that was a good one.

1133
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,450
No idea that would work.

1134
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,600
Larry!

1135
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,680
Hey, YOU guys, how you doing?

1136
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:29,890
Still in one piece!

1137
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,140
-Octavius, I think this belongs to you. -Thank you.

1138
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,390
I don't understand.

1139
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,690
Why is Lancelot staying strong while we get weaker?

1140
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:36,860
It's his first night.

1141
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,570
Newborns are stronger but it matters not.

1142
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,440
Unless we succeed, he, too, will be dead come the dawn.

1143
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:42,610
We can't let him leave the building.

1144
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,610
Sir, can you go back to Egypt, in case he comes through there?

1145
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,530
-Of course. -Nicky, take Attila, check the loading dock.

1146
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,660
-Got it. -Teddy, go to the South Wing, cover the side doors.

1147
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,290
I got the main entrance.

1148
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,960
Hi-yeah!

1149
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,340
You! I knew you smelled a bit off!

1150
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,430
Didn't you just see that?

1151
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:06,760
See what?

1152
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,390
The knight on the horse that just rode through!

1153
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,810
Stop trying to distract me with your magical fantasy!

1154
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,980
I found your filthy twin, here, in the freight room!

1155
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,850
He's not my twin.

1156
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,900
I got him, and what could he say for himself?

1157
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,980
Shut up! Shut up in your face!

1158
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:23,820
Shut up right now! Do you want to be smashed?

1159
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,610
Yeah, you can run, but if you leave those gates...

1160
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,910
I swear to you, your hideous doppelganger...

1161
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,490
who looks a lot like the lead singer of the Counting Crows...

1162
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,790
will get it!

1163
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,460
Dada.

1164
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,620
That's right.

1165
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,540
It compute with him.

1166
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,710
Dada.

1167
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,670
Damn it!

1168
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,890
Laaa.

1169
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,850
If you see me do something dumb, don't imitate me, okay?

1170
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,520
It's basically what I keep telling Nick.

1171
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,650
He just doesn't get it, you know?

1172
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,690
I mean, he's a smart kid...

1173
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,610
but I just want to give him the tools that I didn't have.

1174
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,280
I mean, get the degree, then take a break.

1175
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:12,450
Get the degree, then take a break.

1176
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,330
Laaa! Laaa, stop that!

1177
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,710
Stop it!

1178
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,890
Okay.

1179
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,990
What? Excuse me! Hey!

1180
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,830
Hi. Hey. Sorry.

1181
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:55,330
I'm Nick, this is Dexter, Attila the Hun.

1182
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,910
Oh, yes, so lovely to meet you.

1183
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,370
Now meet this hammer!

1184
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,670
Don't do that.

1185
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,840
I'm super sorry. I know it's a lot going on, Hun, monkey.

1186
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,720
Wow, what? So much weird. Huge amount to process.

1187
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,340
Right? Okay, sorry.

1188
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,260
-Thank you. -You won't get away with this!

1189
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:15,430
I'm making sketches of you in my mind right now!

1190
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,310
Boy with freckles,

1191
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:20,770
fat Asian with hair extensions, evil monkey.

1192
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,020
I guess it's just parenting, you know?

1193
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,900
And he comes from a divorced family...

1194
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,780
so I'm sure he has a lot of conflicted feelings about me...

1195
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:34,700
and there might be some Oedipal stuff at play in there, or...

1196
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,780
I get it.

1197
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:37,120
I wasn't there a lot of the time.

1198
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,370
So I think I might be projecting my own guilt...

1199
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,120
and taking it out on him in ways...

1200
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,080
that I'm not even aware of.

1201
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:45,960
What?

1202
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,800
Door.

1203
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,430
Head.

1204
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,140
Okay, I...

1205
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,560
Open...

1206
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,560
head.

1207
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,310
Open your mind!

1208
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,060
Yes! Yeah, well, you're right.

1209
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,400
That's the challenge.

1210
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,820
I mean, it's all contextual, and I do.

1211
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,150
I keep looking at him

1212
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,650
through the lens of how my parents raised me...

1213
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,990
when, in reality, he's his own person.

1214
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,330
And, yeah, we share the same DNA...

1215
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,990
but honestly, he's much more evolved than I ever was.

1216
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,830
I don't want to let my own ego and childhood history...

1217
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
stop him from making the mistakes he needs to make...

1218
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,790
to become the person that he's meant to be.

1219
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,380
Oh!

1220
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,920
Open the door with your head.

1221
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,010
Yes!

1222
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:33,050
Good, Laaa. Let's go! Ah!

1223
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,510
-Everybody okay? -Yes, Lawrence.

1224
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,850
Attila and your boy secured the lady guard in her booth.

1225
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,600
I don't know how long it will hold her, though.

1226
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:42,810
We gotta find Lancelot...

1227
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,690
but somebody has to make sure she doesn't get out.

1228
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,820
Yeah. Laaa, okay.

1229
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,480
You know what you have to do?

1230
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:51,940
Stay!

1231
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,860
That's right. Just make sure she stays in there.

1232
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,860
-Stay! -Good! Go!

1233
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:57,490
Dada say, "Stay"!

1234
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:58,870
Lawrence!

1235
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,200
I can't move my arms.

1236
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,450
We're becoming less useful by the minute.

1237
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:04,620
Whoa, whoa!

1238
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:06,710
Come on, big guy...

1239
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,000
What? You okay there? Huh?

1240
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,340
Something's up with your eye, but...

1241
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,680
I don't know. It's just kind of going...

1242
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,560
You gotta relax, okay?

1243
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,560
Calm down!

1244
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,060
Attila! Attila!

1245
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,400
Attila doesn't hyperventilate.

1246
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,070
You pillage!

1247
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,480
You plunder!

1248
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,190
You don't freak out.

1249
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,740
Okay?

1250
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,490
Dad, there's, like, 8 million people in this city.

1251
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,330
He could be literally anywhere by now.

1252
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,700
We'll find him.

1253
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,160
We have to.

1254
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:59,260
I'm coming, my love.

1255
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,600
Blimey!

1256
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,270
He came this way...

1257
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,360
traveling 4 leagues perhoun

1258
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:23,910
No!

1259
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,080
Never run from a big cat, Lawrence.

1260
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,210
Gigantor, get your flashlight out!

1261
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,460
These cats want to play!

1262
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:34,210
Whoo-wee! He's got it, boy!

1263
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,640
Well played, sir.

1264
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:45,100
Run!

1265
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,730
Where the devil could Lancelot be?

1266
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,610
Come on!

1267
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,580
You better let me out of here, you revolting ape-man!

1268
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,160
What are you staring at? Stop looking at me!

1269
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:09,870
Have you never seen a beautiful,

1270
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,460
attractive, gorgeous woman before...

1271
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,500
who could be a model if she didn't love pizza so much?

1272
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,250
I know what you're playing at...

1273
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,630
and it ain't working.

1274
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,140
Not working.

1275
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,270
Wait, it is kind of working.

1276
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:46,540
What have they done to Camelot?

1277
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,300
Camelot

1278
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,380
At long last!

1279
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,300
-Guinevere, my love. -Hi.

1280
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:06,850
Can I help you, mate?

1281
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,140
Itisl...

1282
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,730
Sir Lancelot.

1283
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,560
I have fulfilled my quest.

1284
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,190
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1285
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,400
I'm not actually Guinevere.

1286
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,820
I'm Alice Eve, and I think you got a bit confused.

1287
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,820
-Maybe you saw me on stage... -Your voice is like music...

1288
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,740
but I have no idea what you're saying.

1289
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,320
Okay. Hey.

1290
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:24,870
Hey, man.

1291
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:26,240
Hey, buddy. Um...

1292
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,660
What she's saying is she's not Guinevere because she's an actor.

1293
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,580
Okay? So am I.

1294
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:33,920
An actor?

1295
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,080
-Yeah. -Yeah.

1296
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,420
You know?

1297
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,590
Do the crown.

1298
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,710
Oh, sorry, of course. Hugh Jackman.

1299
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,260
It was the crown.

1300
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,430
I know, the whole...

1301
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,680
Huge Ackman?

1302
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,260
Uh... That's a ridiculous name!

1303
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,600
It doesn't even sound real!

1304
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,100
Only a coward would conceal his true identity, Arthur.

1305
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,600
No, it's Hugh Jackman.

1306
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,850
I, on the other hand...

1307
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,560
carry the treasure you sought...

1308
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,020
but could never find.

1309
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,780
Behold the key to life everlasting!

1310
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,410
Okay, I love the costume...

1311
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:06,570
I love the enthusiasm...

1312
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,450
but you're gonna have to get off stage now.

1313
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,790
Sir Lancelot, ladies and gentlemen. Sir Lancelot.

1314
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,040
Yes!

1315
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,210
Very good.

1316
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:15,080
Shame on you, Arthur!

1317
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,040
You don't deserve your crown,

1318
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,750
and you don't deserve your queen!

1319
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:23,760
Prepare to feel the cold kiss of my blade...

1320
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,970
Huge Ackman!

1321
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,640
Hey, buddy, this is all pretend.

1322
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,140
See, just...

1323
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,390
Well, that's not real.

1324
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,480
None of it is.

1325
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:44,820
It's not real.

1326
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,950
It was a good performance.

1327
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:47,780
-We were right in there. -You were tonight.

1328
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,120
But it's not real-real.

1329
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,580
It's not real.

1330
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,910
Not real?

1331
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:59,500
Do you know how long I dreamed of Camelot?

1332
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,840
And for what?

1333
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,960
For nothing!

1334
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,800
Jeez!

1335
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,680
Nothing!

1336
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,470
No, no, no. Please just take your seats and...

1337
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:17,850
What's up?

1338
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,020
We're just as God made us.

1339
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,070
Why don't you take a picture?

1340
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,700
It'll last longer.

1341
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:35,500
Okay, I've tried being nice. That's enough.

1342
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,460
Get off the stage right now!

1343
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,500
Stay back! You don't scare me...

1344
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:40,580
Huge Ackman.

1345
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,380
Listen, mate, you don't want to fight me, all right?

1346
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,300
If we go, I will break you.

1347
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,130
Come on!

1348
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,680
What is that?

1349
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,850
What are you doing?

1350
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,310
He's doing his Wolverine thing.

1351
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,270
Yeah.

1352
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,810
-Yeah. -You know?

1353
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,730
It's better with the claws and no shirt.

1354
01:11:58,890 --> 01:11:59,890
Fair.

1355
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,310
Lancelot!

1356
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,730
Lancelot!

1357
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,570
Oi, mate!

1358
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,320
Hey, buddy, that's not an exit!

1359
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,910
Yeah, come on up.

1360
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,490
Yep. Come on up!

1361
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,700
Oh, monkeys. Terrific.

1362
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:18,080
I love the costumes.

1363
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:21,330
Sorry. I just gotta say, you're the whole package, man.

1364
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,580
Thanks, buddy.

1365
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,710
-He recognized you. -Yeah, that was awesome.

1366
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:28,210
Hey! Give me the tablet!

1367
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,220
Stay back! Stay back.

1368
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:31,840
-Stand back! -Whoa!

1369
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:33,090
Back!

1370
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,850
What?

1371
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,640
Your, uh...

1372
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,770
Your nose, it's...

1373
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,270
What about my nose?

1374
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,730
Your nose is dripping.

1375
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,610
-What? -It's melting. From the fire.

1376
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,530
Okay.

1377
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,860
How bad is it?

1378
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,450
It is not great.

1379
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,780
But I'm Lancelot!

1380
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:55,950
There never was a Lancelot!

1381
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,240
Lancelot is a legend.

1382
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,950
You're not real.

1383
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,120
I don't understand!

1384
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:02,460
I know it's a lot to take in, but please, just give me the tablet.

1385
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,790
Oh, and then what? Back to the museum?

1386
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,300
Stand there as little children ogle and point?

1387
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,460
And learn.

1388
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,050
And get inspired to do great things.

1389
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,130
There are far less noble fates, my friend.

1390
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,800
Not for me, there aren't!

1391
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,760
If there is no Camelot...

1392
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:20,310
there is no Guinevere and no Lancelot...

1393
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,650
then I'm nothing. I'm just a sad lump of misshapen wax.

1394
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,230
Stop looking at my nose!

1395
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,820
-I wasn't looking at it. -You were, I saw you.

1396
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,820
You were like this. "Hmm, hmm." Staring.

1397
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,150
-I wasn't like that. -You were!

1398
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,240
Don't look at it!

1399
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,280
It really is hard not to look at.

1400
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,160
Yes, he is.

1401
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:36,950
Ah!

1402
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,160
-I didn't. -I saw you!

1403
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,330
No, I'm looking at your eyes.

1404
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:40,830
Monkey, stop it!

1405
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,870
Could you give me the tablet, please? Give me the tablet.

1406
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,080
If you give me the tablet, I promise I won't...

1407
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,290
Do not look at my nose!

1408
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,840
-Give me the tablet. -Look away.

1409
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,500
Give me the tablet. How hard could it be not to look at my nose?

1410
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:51,090
I'm not gonna look at your nose.

1411
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,340
I can't help it!

1412
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,590
Look to the heavens!

1413
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:56,680
It's disgusting.

1414
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,350
Yet, he's still handsome.

1415
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,120
No one shall look at, or mention,

1416
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,720
my nose from this moment forward!

1417
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:08,610
I'm sorry, I forgot what we were talking about.

1418
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,240
Lawrence.

1419
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,200
On, Teddy!

1420
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,620
Larry.

1421
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:24,660
We've run out of time.

1422
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:28,540
Listen to me. You got to straighten the pieces.

1423
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,800
Straighten the pieces right now or they're all gonna die!

1424
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,880
You too!

1425
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,670
A world without Camelot is not a world worth living in.

1426
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,220
Dad!

1427
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,350
Dexter, what is it?

1428
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,680
You all right?

1429
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:46,810
Hey.

1430
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,560
Hey, man, you okay?

1431
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:50,320
Hey, look at me.

1432
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,740
Yeah, you want to slap me? Go ahead.

1433
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,490
Go ahead, slap me in the face.

1434
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,030
Dex?

1435
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:07,920
Dexter?

1436
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:09,380
Dexter?

1437
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,750
Oh! No, no. No.

1438
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,260
Dexter? No, no. Come on, man!

1439
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,050
Dad, he's gone.

1440
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,770
I'll take that hand now.

1441
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,110
I understand now.

1442
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:40,950
The monkey was the quest.

1443
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,870
It was never about the tablet.

1444
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,420
It was about them.

1445
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,420
Forgive me.

1446
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:56,420
It is I who have been the fool.

1447
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,610
We're back, baby!

1448
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:18,700
Lawrence!

1449
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:21,570
Whoa!

1450
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,660
Hey!

1451
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,160
Welcome back, buddy.

1452
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,790
Hey.

1453
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:30,420
Well done, Larry!

1454
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,250
There he is. That's our guy.

1455
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,630
Come here!

1456
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,840
Here's your tablet.

1457
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,130
It feels good, doesn't it, Jedediah?

1458
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,800
Boy, you said it!

1459
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,760
Hey. Thank you.

1460
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,030
How do I look?

1461
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:05,700
You look like Lancelot.

1462
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:19,380
Well done, my child.

1463
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,050
Thank you...

1464
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,060
for bringing my son home safely.

1465
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,390
It's a strange thing...

1466
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,320
seeing your boy become a man.

1467
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,900
There were lions chasing us.

1468
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,150
Hmm.

1469
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,900
Yeah, it's crazy.

1470
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,240
One day, they're riding a dinosaur through Central Park...

1471
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:49,370
and then the next day they're DJ-ing in Ibiza.

1472
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,250
You've served my family well.

1473
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:58,880
We shall build a great tomb and bury you with many riches.

1474
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:01,380
I, personally, will see to it that your organs are removed...

1475
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:04,260
and placed in separate jewel-encrusted jars.

1476
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,220
Thank you.

1477
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,180
It's the right thing to do.

1478
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,100
Then we're agreed.

1479
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,430
Lawrence...

1480
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,690
may I have a word?

1481
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:15,940
Yeah.

1482
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,440
The others and I have been talking.

1483
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:22,070
Ahkmenrah's place is here with his family.

1484
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,610
He must remain here.

1485
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:27,280
And the tablet should stay here as well, son.

1486
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:30,410
This is where it belongs, Gigantor.

1487
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:32,250
Yeah, but it...

1488
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,120
That means you guys would have to stay.

1489
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:36,790
We belong in New York.

1490
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,550
Yeah, but if you...

1491
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,590
If you guys go, then you...

1492
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,220
you won't be alive after tonight.

1493
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:48,390
We're museum exhibits, Laredo.

1494
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,640
It's what we are.

1495
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,350
Folks come to look at us,

1496
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,270
maybe learn a little something.

1497
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,480
That's alive, man.

1498
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,310
But I'm...

1499
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,060
I'm supposed to take care of you guys.

1500
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:01,480
And you have.

1501
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,240
It's okay, Lawrence.

1502
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,110
We're ready.

1503
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,320
I'm not.

1504
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:14,290
Let us go, son.

1505
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:21,750
Okay.

1506
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:28,180
Thank you for giving me back my family, Larry...

1507
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:32,850
Guardian of Brooklyn.

1508
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,350
Dad, if we leave right now, we can still catch a flight...

1509
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,980
get home with everyone still awake before the sun comes up.

1510
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,520
Yeah, okay.

1511
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,820
Let's go home.

1512
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,780
Whoa!

1513
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,030
It's all right, Larry.

1514
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,950
We've reached something of an understanding.

1515
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,530
-Really? -Trixey, sit.

1516
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,200
Wow! That's really good.

1517
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,830
Good job, Lance.

1518
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,040
Thanks.

1519
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,670
T?xey, behave.

1520
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,050
Good girl.

1521
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:06,710
Steady.

1522
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,300
He never even listens to me.

1523
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,760
Butyoun.

1524
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:16,060
I just feel like you really listen to me.

1525
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:21,400
It's like our hearts are in perfect sync with each other right now.

1526
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:23,270
Um... Do you feel what...

1527
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,400
Oh. Hi.

1528
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,320
Sorry to interrupt whatever...

1529
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,690
is happening...

1530
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:31,570
Uh, Laaa, the guys are waiting outside. We gotta go. Come on.

1531
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,410
What? No.

1532
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,990
No! Laaa, stay!

1533
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,910
I know this sounds crazy...

1534
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,410
but you and I could make a life together here in England.

1535
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,090
Whoa!

1536
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,300
Wow. Okay. Um...

1537
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:08,780
I will never forget you.

1538
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,450
You are the most rugged man that I have ever, ever met.

1539
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,670
Keep the scrunchies.

1540
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:26,290
Okay, Laaa. We gotta go.

1541
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,840
Come on.

1542
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,880
I won't say anything if you won't.

1543
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,010
Oh, I know you hate this job and everything, but tomorrow night...

1544
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,680
best job ever.

1545
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,850
Sure is quiet around here.

1546
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:28,230
Without the tablet, it's just like any other museum.

1547
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,610
You know what I'm gonna remember most about you?

1548
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,190
What?

1549
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,030
How big you guys are.

1550
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,370
Come here.

1551
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,040
Come here.

1552
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,460
Hold me.

1553
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:53,210
My...

1554
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,220
friend.

1555
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,470
You speak English?

1556
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:08,310
Okay.

1557
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,570
Hey, listen. Um...

1558
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,240
Up there on the roof, when...

1559
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,570
When you almost...

1560
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:22,950
Yeah.

1561
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,170
I just want you to know...

1562
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,460
I really changed my perspective on everything.

1563
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:37,470
I know we have a weird...

1564
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,470
We have this dynamic, we have this tension.

1565
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,350
Back and forth.

1566
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,310
I mean, games, right? You know?

1567
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,350
Roles that we put ourselves into,

1568
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,770
but why does it have to be that way?

1569
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,690
I feel like there's always been a mutual

1570
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,440
sort of respect for each other.

1571
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,660
anyway-

1572
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,990
I'll miss you, you know?

1573
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,620
Okay. It's all right.

1574
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:08,660
Go ahead. One last slap.

1575
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,730
Yeah, I felt that was there for a long time, too.

1576
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,000
Thank you.

1577
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,510
Who would have ever thought?

1578
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,600
I'm wax, she's polyurethane.

1579
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:06,930
But somehow, it worked.

1580
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,520
I guess this is it.

1581
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,770
Indeed.

1582
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:18,190
And I know young Nick will do great things.

1583
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:20,070
Yeah, he's, uh...

1584
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:24,120
ready to take on the world all by himself.

1585
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,200
Then you've done your job.

1586
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,950
You've done your job.

1587
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:33,460
It's time for your next adventure.

1588
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,290
I have no idea what I'm gonna do tomorrow.

1589
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,880
How exciting.

1590
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,930
Bye, Teddy.

1591
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:50,220
Farewell, Lawrence.

1592
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:58,480
Bully!

1593
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:00,400
Got you!

1594
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,740
Smile, my boy.

1595
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,070
It's sunrise.

1596
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,310
-Hey. -Hey. You good?

1597
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:33,850
-Yeah, I am. -Good.

1598
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,770
So, Ibiza?

1599
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:41,820
Yeah. Uh...

1600
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,200
The whole DJ thing, Dad...

1601
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,450
I don't know if that's the thing for me...

1602
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,620
I just know that it's the next thing.

1603
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:51,540
After that, maybe college.

1604
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:55,290
I'm figuring it all out, you know?

1605
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:57,960
Sounds like a plan.

1606
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,460
I should get back to Mom's, or something.

1607
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:03,960
Okay.

1608
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,510
I love you.

1609
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,800
I love you, too.

1610
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,470
All right.

1611
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,480
I'm not gonna let you go.

1612
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,810
Okay. I'll see you later.

1613
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:01,520
Three years, no Larry Daley.

1614
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:05,190
He was the one that took the fall for me, got me my job back.

1615
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,110
I heard he went back to school,

1616
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:09,200
got his degree, became a teacher.

1617
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,450
I'm very glad.

1618
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:13,450
Well, when he heard about this traveling exhibition...

1619
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:16,700
Larry insisted that I deliver this to you personally.

1620
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:22,960
Ah! The infamous, supposedly magic, glowing tablet.

1621
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,380
Larry Daley and his fanciful tales.

1622
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,300
Larry said you could be trusted.

1623
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:29,380
What do you mean?

1624
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,560
With the top secret knowledge.

1625
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,720
What are you doing?

1626
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,930
-I'm winking. -You're blinking.

1627
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,020
No, I wink with both eyes.

1628
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,190
That's blinking.

1629
01:28:42,270 --> 01:28:44,320
It doesn't matter, because right now...

1630
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,900
you better get ready!

1631
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:47,280
For what?

1632
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,400
For this.

1633
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,160
It does glow.

1634
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,300
Come on.

1635
01:29:58,220 --> 01:29:59,390
Sorry.

1636
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,060
Go ahead.

1637
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,680
Have fun-fun, Dum Dum.

1638
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,020
Stay!

1639
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:45,690
I'm not going anywhere.

1640
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,270
Stay!

1641
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,860
I'm not going anywhere!

1641
01:30:49,305 --> 01:30:55,444
